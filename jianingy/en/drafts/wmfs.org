* Introduction to WMFS

WMFS is my current window manager. I choose it because of two reasons.
First, it is a tiled window manager which means that the window
manager could arrange various windows according to some mathmatical
pattern. Otherwise, I may need to place them in a comfortable way
everytime I open a new one. Second, I like its configuration style. I
admit that LUA as configuration is pretty cool. However, since I am
not familiar with LUA, WMFS offers me a good start.

Here comes a screenshot of my desktop,

* Configuration

** Fonts

I use "PF Tempesta Seven", a beatiful samll font, as default font for WMFS.

#+begin_example
[misc]
        font                  = "PF Tempesta Seven:style=Regular:pixelsize=8"
[/misc]
#+end_example

** SysTray

When there are multiple monitors, wmfs enables us to fix the systray on only one of them.

#+begin_example
[bar]
  [systray]
    # Enable/disable systray
    active = true

    # Screen of systray
    screen = 0

    # Spacing between tray icons
    spacing = 3
  [/systray]
[/bar]
#+end_example

** Layouts

We can define a layout menu and put frequent layout into it. It is
better to associate each layout with a thumb so that it will be easier
to figure out what is the current layout and how the layout gonna
place windows. Fortunately, there is no need to draw our own thumbs. A
sample is avaiable at [[http://ompldr.org/vOHN3dA]]. Unfortunately, it
seems that the path to the thumb file must be absolute path.

#+begin_example
[layouts]

    [layout]
        type = "tile_right"
        symbol = "\i[13;4;15;13;/home/jianingy/.config/wmfs/bl/tr.png]\"
    [/layout]
    [layout]
        type = "tile_left"
        symbol = "\i[13;4;15;13;/home/jianingy/.config/wmfs/bl/tl.png]\"
    [/layout]

    [layout]
        type = "tile_top"
        symbol = "\i[13;4;15;13;/home/jianingy/.config/wmfs/bl/tt.png]\"
    [/layout]
    [layout]
        type = "tile_bottom"
        symbol = "\i[13;4;15;13;/home/jianingy/.config/wmfs/bl/tb.png]\"
    [/layout]

    [layout]
        type = "tile_grid"
        symbol = "\i[13;4;15;13;/home/jianingy/.config/wmfs/bl/tg.png]\"
    [/layout]
    [layout]
        type = "tile_grid_vertical"
        symbol = "\i[13;4;15;13;/home/jianingy/.config/wmfs/bl/tg.png]\"
    [/layout]


    [layout]
        type = "mirror_vertical"
        symbol = "\i[13;4;15;13;/home/jianingy/.config/wmfs/bl/mv.png]\"
    [/layout]
    [layout]
        type = "mirror_horizontal"
        symbol = "\i[13;4;15;13;/home/jianingy/.config/wmfs/bl/mh.png]\"
    [/layout]

    # Other layouts.
    [layout]
        type = "max"
        symbol = "\i[13;4;15;13;/home/jianingy/.config/wmfs/bl/max.png]\"
    [/layout]
    [layout]
        type = "free"
        symbol = "\i[13;4;15;13;/home/jianingy/.config/wmfs/bl/fr.png]\"
    [/layout]

** Tags

Tags is something like workspaces in other window managers such as
gnome and KDE. Like other window managers, its name can be customized.
For example, mine follows the name of dragons in Azeroth World. The
setting of tags can be different to each monitor, not only its name
but also default layout.

#+begin_example
[tags]
    [tag]
            name             = "1/Onyxia"
            screen           = 0
            mwfact           = 0.85
            nmaster          = 1
            layout           = "tile_bottom"
            resizehint       = false
            infobar_position = "top"
            above_fc         = false
            #[mouse] [/mouse] Possible multi mouse section
    [/tag]

    # screen 0
    [tag] name = "2/Sindragosa"   layout = "tile_grid" screen = 0 [/tag]
    [tag] name = "3/Saragosa"     layout = "tile_grid" screen = 0 [/tag]
    [tag] name = "4/Tyrygosa"     layout = "tile_grid" screen = 0 [/tag]

    # screen 1
    [tag] name = "1/Azeroth"      layout = "free"      screen = 1 [/tag]
    [tag] name = "2/Outland"      layout = "free"      screen = 1 [/tag]
    [tag] name = "3/Northenland"  layout = "free"      screen = 1 [/tag]
[/tags]
